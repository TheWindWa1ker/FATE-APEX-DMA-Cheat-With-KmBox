Alright, after some consideration, I have decided to make my source code public. I hope that my project can attract some fresh blood, and I don't want it to be sold, but rather kept open source and updated.

My project initially started as a modification of Eehh's project, and I think I messed up quite a bit, writing a lot of poor-quality code.

The current features include:

ESP:

BOX [Custom colors with or without cover]
HealthBar [Seer style and ALGS style]
LINE
DISTANCE
NAME
TEAM
RANK
LEVEL
Skeleton [Incomplete, commented out]
Show Pro
Display blacklist and whitelist


PlayerList [Displays information of all players and the ability to add players to the blacklist or whitelist]


Aimbot:

Aimbot Smooth
FlickBot
Flick Smooth
TriggerBot [With Prediction]
Aimbot with KmBox or Memory Writing
Skynade with KmBox



Misc:

SuperGlide [Almost 100% successful]
TS And RubbitJump [Some unresolved issues]
Auto Grapple [Incomplete]
Fusion Mode
Take TwoGun Bug [Using KmBox to do it]
Show Spector



Config System:

Configurations are saved using the json library. There are better ways to save configurations, such as SerializeToFile and DeserializeFromFile, but I don't have more free time to complete it.


There might be some other features that I haven't mentioned, but that's the general idea. I used Clion as my IDE, so the source code includes a CMakeLists.txt. You will need to manually modify the CMakeLists.txt to use it properly.
